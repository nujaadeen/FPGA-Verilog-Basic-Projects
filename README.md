# FPGA-Verilog-Basic-Projects
This repository contains a collection of small FPGA projects implemented using Verilog. These projects were created specifically to showcase a collection of small FPGA projects designed to explain digital design and FPGA programming. These projects were developed to engage and educate visitors at the EXMO 2023 exhibition about the fascinating world of FPGAs and their applications.
1. Parking System:
Description: An FPGA-based parking system that simulates the entry and exit of vehicles from a parking lot, with LED indicators for occupied parking spots.


2. Variable Incrementor:
Description: An FPGA module that acts as a sub-functionality of an ATM machine. It increments a given balance by 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 based on the user's selected withdrawal amount, providing the flexibility to withdraw different denominations.


3. Logic Circuit:
Description: An FPGA-based logic circuit that can be compared to the security mechanism of a bank vault. It performs logical operations and ensures that access is granted only when the correct combination of inputs is provided.


4. Upcounter:
Description: An up-counter module designed to count from 0 to 9, reset, and then count again, suitable for applications like simple digital clocks or timers.

Board Compatibility:
These projects were developed using the Xilinx Bysys 2 FPGA board. The constraint file for the board can be found in the 'constraints' directory, allowing you to map the design to the physical pins and observe the visual outputs on switches, LEDs, and the 7-segment display on the FPGA board.

Contributions:
This repository is primarily designed for exhibition purposes, but if you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, we appreciate your feedback! While we may not accept external contributions during the exhibition, we encourage you to create a fork of the repository and use it for your own educational and exploratory purposes.
